# Java-Text-Editor
Basic text editor written in Java. 

I mean, it does what it says on the tin, it's a text editor GUI application written in Java, it edits text files, can make new ones,
and you can save the files you edit.

I have only tested it on a Mac, so if there are any issues with it on Windows or other Operating systems please let me know!
